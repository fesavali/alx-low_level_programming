A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, 
and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used 
in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures.

Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements 
stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index. Linked lists are less rigid in their storage 
structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations, hence they need to be stored with additional 
tags giving a reference to the next element. This difference in the data storage scheme decides which data structure would be 
more suitable for a given situation.
